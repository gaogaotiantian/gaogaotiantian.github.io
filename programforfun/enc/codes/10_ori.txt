I did not fall in love I fell through it
Came out the other side moments later hands full of matter waking up from the dream of a bullet tearing through the middle of my body
I no longer understand anything for longer than a long moment or the time it takes to receive the shot
This kind of gravity is like falling through a cloud forgetting it all and then being told about it later On the day you fell through a cloud
It must be true If it were not then when did these strands of silver netting attach to my hair
The problem was finding that you were real and not just a dream of clouds
If you were not real I would address this letter to one of two entities myself or everyone else The effect would be equivalent
The act of falling happens in time That is it takes long enough for the falling to shear away from the moments before and the moments after long enough for one to have thought I am falling I have been falling I continue to fall
Falling through a ring in this case would not mean falling through the center of the annulus a planet floats there Falling through the ring means falling through the spaces between the objects that together make the ring
On the way through clasp your fists around the universe
Nothing but icegravel
But open your hands when you reach the other side Quickly before it melts
What did I leave you
