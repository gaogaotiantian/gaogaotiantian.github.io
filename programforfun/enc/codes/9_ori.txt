Somewhere or other there must surely be
The face not seen the voice not heard
The heart that not yet never yet ah me
Made answer to my word

Somewhere or other may be near or far
Past land and sea clean out of sight
Beyond the wandering moon beyond the star
That tracks her night by night

Somewhere or other may be far or near
With just a wall a hedge between
With just the last leaves of the dying year
Fallen on a turf grown green
